### README for Common

## Description
Common contains all of the data structures that we need to run our server. We forward-declare all of the structures our server uses in server_structs.h. 

## Function Prototypes
Common has no function prototypes. It only contains the forward declaration of all of our data structures.

## Control flow
Common doesn't contain any functions, so there is no relevant control flow.

## libraries:
Common includes libcs50 and the message module

## Error handling
Common has no functions, so it doesn't need to handle errors
