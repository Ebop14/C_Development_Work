# Nuggets

This is the bashy bunch's (aka group 2's) nuggets game. 

## Modules 
Our nuggets game is decomposed into two modules: the client and the server.

### Client
The client side handles the individual player's view of the game, and the corresponding keystrokes. In essence, the client allows a human to join the game as an interactive player or as a spectator.

### Server
The server side hosts the nuggets game and changes aspects of the game whenever a client inputs a relevant keystroke. 

## libraries: 
The nuggets game makes use of the libcs50 library and the support library.
